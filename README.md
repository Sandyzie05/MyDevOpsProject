# MyDevOpsProject
This a devops project based on Vagrant, Ansible and Jenkins. I have used Vagrant to provision 4 servers called client, web, db and jenkins. The client machine is the dev/Control machine and is used for accessing the other machines. We have 3 'yaml' files for the configuring the application, db and jenkins server.
